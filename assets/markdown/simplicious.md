[Simplicious](http://simplicious.dominicmayhew.ca): Make food easy. Simplicious helps you make meal plans and routines that are as flexible and creative as you are.

This project is currently a high-fidelity prototype, undergoing interaction design evaluation. It is another Angular app and currently has no back end or data persistence. As a prototype created over one or two weeks, I am proud of it, but it needs significant work before it is adequately usable and useful, and needs a back end.

Through this project I learned more about Angular app development and how challenging it is to create great user experiences.

This project was created as part of a "Human-Computer Interaction" course.
