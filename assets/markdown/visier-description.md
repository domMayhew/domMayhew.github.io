At Visier I quickly became a valuable member of my team, at times even taking a leadership role with less experienced coops. I completed four significant client-facing projects that added value to Visier's SasS application in the following ways:
- *Project:* Publish a simple example and test enablement application
  - *Value:* **Reduce customer onboarding time**
- *Project:* Create a custom user-interface for API documentation
  - *Value:* **Increase customer comprehension**
- *Project:* Develop a new set of public-facing RESTful API endoints for enterprise customers
  - *Value:* **Increase customization for multi-tenant customers**
- *Project:* Cause batch jobs to fail when child jobs fail
  - *Value:* **Enhance visibility of errors in complex customer workflows**

Through these projects I developed and demonstrated the following skills:
- **Analyze** and **design** function, nonfunctional, and security requirements

  - Mentor, guide, and collaborate with less experienced coops and other junior employees
