During my eight month co-op position at Visier Inc., I directly added value to their SaSS application when I improved UX through a new set of **public-facing RESTful API** endoints for enterprise customers, **reduced customer onboarding time** with a simple example and test enablement application, and **increased customer comprehension** via a custom user-interface for API documentation that leveraged SwaggerUI. These and other projects required me to:
- **Analyze** and **design** function, nonfunctional, and security requirements
- Develop and communicate software **architecutre** and **designs**
- Demonstrate **leadership**: mentored, guided, and collaborated with less experienced coops and other junior employees
- Write **scalable**, **testable**, and **reliable** code
  - Write **test plans** and have them pass review
  - Write **unit, integration,** and **end-to-end tests**
- **Communicate** effectively with technical and nontechnical stakeholders
  - Write extensive user-facing technical **documentation**
- Provide **code review** with quality feedback for less experience coops
- Apply **flexibility**, **teamwork**, and **cross-team collaboration** skills
- **Learn** many new technologies
- Research and select available **3rd party tools**
- Use **Linux** and **bash scripting** skills to automate tedious processes and improve developer workflow
- Follow **Agile** software development standards
  - Maintain **quality standards** through version control, code review, automated testing, and CI/CD
