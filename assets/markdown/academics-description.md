I will complete my Bachelor of Computing Science in January 2024 through Thompson Rivers University. This degree has given me a broad and well-rounded understanding of fundamental computer science concepts, including:
- Algorithm design and analysis
- Data structures and their appropriate uses
- Operating System use and design
- Network patterns and protocols
- Security considerations
- Database management and use
- Software architecture and design patterns and communication

I have also been fortunate enough to take some interesting electives:
- Applied Artificial Intelligence
- Haskell language introduction
- Embedded/Robotic Programming
