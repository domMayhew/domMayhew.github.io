I am a 30 year-old full stack software developer who is passionate about his craft. I am a strong communicator, good team player, and fast-learner. I will be graduating with a Bachelor of Computing Science in January, 2024. I have taken a winding road to get to this point, so I feel lucky to be embarking on a long and productive career in software development. I believe I can add value to your team in a few ways:
1. I am *resourceful*, *self-starting*, and *independent*. My degree is entirely online, self-paced, and almost without support from faculty. This means I have had to learn how to find solutions on my own, teach myself the missing links, and be self-motivated. I, like any other junior developer, will need help--but you won't have to hold my hand.
1. I *adapt* to new situations and technologies quickly. I love learning new things and I thrive when thrown into new areas. My projects and interests range from front end and back end web development all the way to embedded systems.
1. I have a *track record*. During my eight month coop at Visier Inc. I quickly became a valuable member of the team.
1. I bring *maturity*. As an older graduate, I bring more life experience than most. I have a background in people-oriented professions where I learned leadership, teamwork, and communication skills.

Thank you for your interest! If you think I could be a good fit, let's discuss how I can contribute to your team's goals!

Dominic
