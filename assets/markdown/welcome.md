Thanks for checking out my interactive resume!
* Use the scroll wheel to zoom in/out
* Double click on an item to see inner items

**Disclaimer/Known bugs**: This project does not support mobile devices yet. This project is a work in progress and there are still a few bugs and areas for improvement.
* I used `ngx-graph` to lay out the nodes in the graph, but it is not as flexible as I had hoped. I have plans for a future design that do not depend on `ngx-graph`.
* Sometimes the edges do not highlight appropriately.
* Firefox lays out the close button on the modals in an odd way.
