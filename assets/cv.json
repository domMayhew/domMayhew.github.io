Embedding a SasS product into your own has complications surrounding *CORS policies*, cross-site scripting, and authentication (in this case, SAML 2.0). I wrote an application that provided:\n\n1. A live example of embedding Visier's software in **less than five minutes configuration**.\n1. Example code that users could duplicate in their own application.\n1. A live reference of working SAML authentications.\n1. Extensive technical documentation.\n\nThe project is published on [Visier's public GitHub](https://github.com/visier/embedding-exemplar).",
